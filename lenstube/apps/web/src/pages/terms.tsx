          </p>
          <p>
            Any use, reliance on, or collection of any User Content or materials
            displayed via the Services or obtained by you through the Services
            is at your own risk. We do not endorse, support, represent or
            guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability
            of any User Content or communications posted via the Services or
            endorse any opinions expressed via the Services. You understand that
            by using the Services, you may be exposed to User Content that might
            be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in
            some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise
            deceptive. All User Content is the sole responsibility of the person
            who originated such User Content. We may not monitor or control the
            User Content posted via the Services and, we cannot take

            User Content may embody, comprise or otherwise be associated with
            certain characters, artwork, or other work of authorship ("Artwork")
            made available by Channels (who may represent artists, musicians and
            other creators) for collecting in the form of non-fungible tokens (a
            “Token" or “Tokens”).
          </p>
          <p>
            All transactions related to the Service, including making a Token
            available for collecting are effected and recorded solely through
            the interactions of the Channel with the blockchain based networks,
            which are not under the control of or affiliated with the Service.
            The Service does not hold, and cannot purchase, sell, or trade any
            tokens, nor can the Service set, change or enforce any conditions
            for collecting set by the Channel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon you collecting a Token, although the Token is owned by you, the
            Artwork embodied thereby is licensed and not transferred or sold to
            you. Ownership means that the ownership of the Token is recoded on
            blockchain-based networks. Subject to your lawful acquisition, and
            continued ownership of a Token, the user controlling the Channel
            grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free
            license, with no right to sublicense, on as-is basis, to display the
            Artwork embodied by such Token(s), unless a more expansive license
            is granted to you in accordance with the Token metadata. For the
            avoidance of doubt, to be granted the license above, you must
            independently verify the right of the user controlling the Channel
            to make the Token available for collecting (including, without
            limitation, copyright).
          </p>
          <p>
            All Tokens are provided by the Channels on an as-is basis without
            any warranty or representation of any kind, express or implied. The
            Tokens may contain errors and it is the responsibility of the
            acquiring user to independently verify the accuracy, completeness
            and suitability for the purpose of the Token before collecting.
          </p>
