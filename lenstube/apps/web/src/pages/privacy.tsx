          <h2>1. Overview</h2>
          <p>
            By accessing the Site, you agree to not only this Privacy Policy,
            but also to our <Link href="/terms">terms of use</Link> and any
            other written agreements for using the Site. And you agree to our
            collection and use of any personal data (as described here) as well
            as the features of public/permissionless blockchain technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) provides a comprehensive
            description of how Lenstube (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses,
            and shares information about you in connection with the website at
            “lenstube.xyz”, as well as your rights and choices regarding such
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            By accessing or using the Site, you accept and assume certain
            inherent features related to engaging in recording the data on the
            blockchain. Interactions with the Lens Protocol rely on smart
            contracts stored on a publicly available blockchain, cryptographic
            tokens generated by the smart contracts, and other nascent software,
            applications and systems that interact with blockchain-based
            networks. One of the defining features of blockchain technology is
            that its entries are immutable, which means, as a technical matter,
            they generally cannot be deleted or modified by anyone. If you are
            not comfortable assuming the inherently immutable and public nature
            of all entries on the blockchain, you should not engage with our
            Site.
          </p>
          <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
          <p>

              automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to the online

              as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these
              signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to
              require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect
              to “Do Not Track” signals. For more information on “Do Not Track,”
