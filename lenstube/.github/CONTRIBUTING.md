# ü§ù Contributing to Lenstube

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be well tested.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!
5. The Pull Request should be raised against main branch.

Feel free to contact us if any issues.

## Report bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/lenstube-xyz/lenstube/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, and background

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Additional info if any
